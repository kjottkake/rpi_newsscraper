# News Scrapper! Where we scrape the shit out of news!

## What it do:

This is a news scraping script that does 3 things. 
1. It fetches news headines, urls and images from various news agencies' websites.
2. It compiles the headlines and images into a new consolidated list.
3. Our consolidated news is published and hosted via an nginX server.

## How it does it.
Two scraping bash scripts reads tv2.no/nyheter and extracts URLS, titles, and images of various news articles.
